“Space Shooter” is an exciting 2D arcade game developed using Python and the Pygame library. Before diving into the gameplay, let’s familiarize ourselves with the key elements of the game:

    Player’s Ship - the green object that you control and use to shoot. This is your primary tool for combating enemies in the game.

    Projectiles - yellow bullets that you can fire to destroy enemies. These projectiles deal damage to enemies upon impact.

    Enemies - red blocks with white “eyes”. They are vulnerable to your projectiles, but if your ship comes into contact with an enemy, the game will end.

The game controls are intuitive: you can maneuver your ship and shoot at incoming enemies, aiming to avoid any collisions. Your objective is to survive as long as possible, eliminating enemies and scoring points.

_**Good luck in your space battles!**_
